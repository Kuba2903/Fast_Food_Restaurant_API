# Fast_Food_Restaurant_API
Created menu for restaurant. Drinks are created with decorator design pattern so you can choose which drink additivies you want. Foods are created with abstract fabric to create a family with related
objects for example like different types of pizzas. You are able to make an order with the Waitress and Facade classes. Facade is for the easier usage of the application.
